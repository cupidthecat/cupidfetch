# Cupidfetch

## Overview
Cupidfetch is a system information retrieval tool written in C, designed for Linux systems. It's a beginner-friendly, work-in-progress hobby project aimed at learning and exploring programming concepts.

## Features
- Fetches and displays various system details such as hostname, distribution, kernel version, uptime, package count, shell, desktop environment, and username.
- Uses ASCII art (soon) and Unicode icons (soon) to enhance the visual representation of information.
- Built with simplicity in mind for beginners to understand and contribute.

## Usage
1. **Compilation:** Compile the program using `gcc -o cupidfetch cupidfetch.c`.
2. **Execution:** Run the compiled program using `./cupidfetch`.
3. **Output:** Cupidfetch will display system information, including ASCII art representing the Linux distribution (WIP) and Unicode icons (WIP) for different details.

## Requirements
- Linux-based system
- Basic understanding of C programming
- Curiosity to explore system information gathering

## How to Contribute
As a beginner-friendly project, contributions from all skill levels are welcomed and appreciated. If you're new to programming and looking to learn, this project is an excellent opportunity to get involved and contribute.

## To-do list
- I want to add ASCII art for each distro with custom kitty art too
- Add colors at the bottom
- Fix alignment with text so ascii art looks correct

## Note
This project is a work in progress and serves as a hobby project for learning and experimentation.
